# Development
Us 4 had two weeks to create a game within the limits of 64x64 resolution. As fans of the rougelite genre we decided to endeavour on one of our own. Using assets created by Krishna Palacio, we programmed a 3 floor 1 boss rogutelite dungeon game in C# using the Unity Engine. This being our second game jam ever, we still had to face constant challenges due to our ignorance towards game development in Unity. However, we believe we did an extradonary job, and as a group, are extremely proud of what we created. There are many MANY areas of this game that could be better, but the two-week development journey was an experience we will be grateful for. 

# Game Jam results
Labyrinth ended up coming #143 out of 337 differnet submissions. We excleed in some aspects, but lacked in others. Learning a lot about Teamwork, Programming, and Game Design, we consider this game jam an extremely fun expereince where we all walked away knowing a little more about programming than we did beforehand.
